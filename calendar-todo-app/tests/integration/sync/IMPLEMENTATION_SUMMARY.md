3. **Real-time Updates** (`realtime_updates.test.ts`) - 38 tests
4. **Offline Sync** (`offline_sync.test.ts`) - 41 tests
5. **Test Executor** (`sync_test_executor.ts`) - Orchestration framework

**Total Implementation:**
- **176 individual tests** across 4 critical synchronization areas
- **Comprehensive edge case coverage** including error conditions
- **Performance benchmarks** for scalability validation
- **Cross-platform compatibility** testing with timezone handling
- **Security validation** including authentication and authorization

### Phase 3: Organization and Documentation ✅ COMPLETED
