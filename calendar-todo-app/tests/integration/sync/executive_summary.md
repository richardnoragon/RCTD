## Outstanding Issues (5 Tests)

### Critical Priority
1. **Optimistic Locking** (`conflict_resolution.test.ts`)
   - Issue: Version tracking mechanism incomplete
   - Impact: Data consistency in concurrent modifications
   - Estimated Fix: 2-3 hours

2. **Data Corruption Handling** (`offline_sync.test.ts`)
   - Issue: Offline data validation incomplete
   - Impact: Data integrity during offline operations
   - Estimated Fix: 4-5 hours

### Medium Priority
3. **Circular Link Prevention** (`event_task_linking.test.ts`)
   - Issue: Edge case validation needs refinement
   - Impact: Dependency loop prevention
   - Estimated Fix: 1-2 hours

4. **Error Recovery** (`conflict_resolution.test.ts`)
   - Issue: Recovery pathway incomplete
   - Impact: System resilience
   - Estimated Fix: 2-3 hours

5. **Delta Sync Optimization** (`offline_sync.test.ts`)
   - Issue: Performance algorithm needs refinement
   - Impact: Sync efficiency
   - Estimated Fix: 3-4 hours
