- **Documentation Review:** Assessed existing integration_test_overview.md and technical documentation

**Key Findings:**
- UI matrix achieved 100% success (resolved earlier)
- Root matrix had 0% success due to infrastructure issues
- Missing proper Jest configuration for root-level tests
- Tauri API mocking dependency conflicts

### ✅ Task 2: Adapt and Re-execute Viable Existing Tests
**Status: COMPLETED**

- **Updated Test Files:** Modified all 4 existing recurrence test files to use new infrastructure
- **Enhanced Setup:** Created `rootIntegrationTestSetup.ts` for independent mock framework
- **Configuration Migration:** Adapted tests from UI setup to root setup patterns
- **Validation Testing:** Verified each test file individually before matrix execution

**Tests Migrated:**
- ✅ `date_time_recurrence_daily.test.ts` - Updated and operational
- ✅ `date_time_recurrence_weekly.test.ts` - Updated and operational
- ✅ `date_time_recurrence_monthly.test.ts` - Updated and operational
- ✅ `date_time_recurrence_custom_patterns.test.ts` - Updated and operational

### ✅ Task 3: Design and Implement New Comprehensive Test Cases
**Status: COMPLETED**

- **Edge Cases Suite (DTTZ-EDGE-001):** Created comprehensive edge case testing
  - Year boundaries (Y2K, leap years, century transitions)
  - Timezone discontinuities (Samoa date line jump, unusual offsets)
  - Complex DST scenarios (negative DST, unusual rules)
  - Calendar anomalies (leap seconds, February 29th validation)
  - Extreme timezone offsets and performance under load

- **Performance Suite (DTTZ-PERF-001):** Created stress and performance testing
  - High-volume timezone conversions (5,000-10,000 operations)
  - Concurrent recurrence calculations (50 threads × 20 calculations)
  - Memory pressure testing and recovery validation
  - Cache efficiency optimization across hot/warm/cold scenarios
  - Extreme data set stress testing

**New Test Files Created:**
- 🆕 `date_time_edge_cases.test.ts` - 6 comprehensive edge case scenarios
- 🆕 `date_time_performance.test.ts` - 5 performance and stress test scenarios

### ✅ Task 4: Execute All Tests Systematically
**Status: COMPLETED**

- **Infrastructure Resolution:** Fixed Jest configuration with `jest.root.config.simplified.cjs`
- **Dependency Management:** Resolved @tauri-apps/api conflicts with virtual mocking
- **Matrix Execution:** Successfully executed complete root matrix across all 9 timezones
- **Performance Monitoring:** Captured detailed execution metrics and performance data

**Execution Results:**
- **Total Execution ID:** `root_date_time_matrix_20250907T150338Z`
- **Total Duration:** 137,360ms (2m 17s)
- **Success Rate:** 100% (9/9 timezones)
- **Average Per-Timezone:** 15,197ms with comprehensive coverage
- **Test Suites Executed:** 6 complete test suites with 30+ individual tests

### ✅ Task 5: Organize and Archive Test Files
**Status: COMPLETED**

- **File Structure Optimization:** Organized all test files with clear naming conventions
- **Version Control:** All files properly committed with descriptive commit messages
- **Documentation Updates:** Comprehensive updates to integration_test_overview.md
- **Artifact Management:** Organized results, logs, and configuration files

**File Organization:**
