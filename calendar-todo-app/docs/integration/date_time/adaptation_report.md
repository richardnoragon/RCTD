# Date/Time Integration Phase 1 Adaptation Report

Project: Calendar-Todo Application  
Version: 1.0.0  
Last Updated (UTC): 2025-09-07T12:07:47Z

1. Purpose
Summarize historical analysis of existing date and time tests, reusable components, adaptation to the designated folder structure and timezone matrix, and deltas introduced to support deterministic, reproducible integration execution.

2. Sources Reviewed

- Integration overview: [integration_test_overview.md](../../tests/integration/integration_test_overview.md)
- Integration setup harness: [integrationTestSetup.ts](../../tests/integration/integrationTestSetup.ts)
- Date/Time setup and utilities: [datetime_test_setup.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/datetime_test_setup.ts)
- Date/Time executor (conceptual): [datetime_test_executor.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/datetime_test_executor.ts)
- Category test suites:
  - [timezone_conversion.test.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/timezone_conversion.test.ts)
  - [dst_handling.test.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/dst_handling.test.ts)
  - [date_formatting.test.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/date_formatting.test.ts)
  - [time_range_validation.test.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/time_range_validation.test.ts)
- UI basic datetime tests: [timezone_basic.test.ts](../../ui/src/tests/integration/datetime/timezone_basic.test.ts)

3. Reusable Assets Identified

- Global Tauri invoke mocking and response control with temporary errors: [integrationTestSetup.ts](../../tests/integration/integrationTestSetup.ts)
- Date/Time-specific global result capture via global.recordDateTimeTestResult in [datetime_test_setup.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/datetime_test_setup.ts)
- Test data factories and utilities: DateTimeTestDataFactory and TimezoneTestUtils in [datetime_test_setup.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/datetime_test_setup.ts:92)
- Comprehensive test coverage foundations across timezone, DST, formatting, and validation in existing suites

4. Gaps vs Required Scope

- Designated artifact structure not yet adopted for date_time
- No recurrence-specific tests covering RRULE, EXDATE, RDATE, COUNT, UNTIL
- No end-to-end matrix runner orchestrating IANA timezone coverage across both backend-like integration and UI layers
- Deterministic clock control is implicit; requires standardization and helpers
- Results/logging rollups and naming conventions not yet centralized under results/integration/date_time and logs/integration/date_time
- No traceability map using DTTZ IDs

5. Adaptation Strategy

- Create designated directories and documentation under docs/integration/date_time and tests/integration/date_time
- Implement runner scripts to execute:
  - UI Jest tests within [ui](../../ui/package.json)
  - Integration datetime suites under tests/integration/datetime via a Jest config extender invoked from scripts
- Enforce explicit timezones using MATRIX_TZ and deterministic time via fixed clock helpers
- Aggregate artifacts to results/logs using standardized filenames
- Maintain traceability using DTTZ IDs in [traceability_map.md](traceability_map.md)

6. Detected Frameworks and Runtimes

- Jest 29 with TypeScript transformer ts-jest: [ui/package.json](../../ui/package.json), [jest.config.js](../../ui/jest.config.js)
- Root test script delegates to UI: [package.json](../../package.json)
- No root-level Jest; integration datetime tests will be executed by an extended Jest config from scripts

7. Deterministic Time Control

- Use Jest modern fake timers for modules that rely on timers
- Provide a small test time utility that wraps Date.now() and new Date() usage where mocks are needed
- Freeze, advance, reset primitives exposed in a shared helper to be imported by new recurrence tests

8. Timezone Matrix and Environment Handling

- Timezones under test: UTC, America/New_York, Europe/Berlin, Asia/Kolkata, Australia/Sydney, Pacific/Apia, Pacific/Chatham, Asia/Tehran, America/Santiago
- Tests must never rely on host defaults; all Intl operations use explicit { timeZone: MATRIX_TZ }
- Capture environment details per run: Node version, process.versions.icu, Intl.supportedValuesOf timeZone length, default Intl timeZone

9. Data Storage and Serialization Validations

- Assert UTC normalization on persisted timestamps in simulated writes
- Assert RFC 3339 or ISO-8601 with offsets where required on payloads
- Verify round-trip fidelity and sort stability by timestamp

10. Recurrence Test Plan Additions

- New tests under tests/integration/date_time/recurrence:
  - date_time_recurrence_daily.test.ts
  - date_time_recurrence_weekly.test.ts
  - date_time_recurrence_monthly.test.ts
  - date_time_recurrence_custom_patterns.test.ts
  - date_time_recurrence_exceptions.test.ts
- Validate generation under matrix timezones and DST; assert count-in-window, ordering, UTC timestamps, local renderings, and idempotent regeneration

11. Traceability and DTTZ ID Assignment

- Categories and prefixes:
  - Timezone Conversion: DTTZ-TZC-###
  - DST Handling: DTTZ-DST-###
  - Date Formatting: DTTZ-FMT-###
  - Time Range Validation: DTTZ-TRV-###
  - Recurrence: DTTZ-RRULE-###
- Mapping will be maintained in [traceability_map.md](traceability_map.md)

12. Reuse and Adaptation Details

- Reused as-is:
  - Tauri invoke mocking and response injection from [integrationTestSetup.ts](../../tests/integration/integrationTestSetup.ts)
  - Data factories and utilities from [datetime_test_setup.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/datetime_test_setup.ts)
- Adapted:
  - Execution orchestration moved to scripts that call Jest with an extended config to include tests under tests/integration/datetime
  - Standardized recording and artifact emission; add summary writers
- New:
  - Recurrence tests plus fixed-clock utilities and matrix runner scripts

13. DST Reference Dates and Coverage

- Americas, Europe, and Southern Hemisphere transitions pulled from test data in [datetime_test_setup.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/datetime_test_setup.ts:365)
- Historical transitions and rule changes covered in [dst_handling.test.ts](../../tests/integration/datetime/dst_handling.test.ts)

14. Results and Logging Plan

- Emit per-run, per-category logs under logs/integration/date_time with filenames date_time_{category}_{descriptor}_{UTC}.log
- Emit JSON and MD rollups under results/integration/date_time as results_summary.json and results_summary.md

15. Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Executing tests outside UI root without a root Jest config
  - Mitigation: Provide a Jest config extender used by scripts to run integration datetime suites
- Risk: Timezone dependence on host environment
  - Mitigation: Explicit Intl timeZone per operation; prevent reliance on process.env.TZ
- Risk: Recurrence semantics variability
  - Mitigation: Treat integration focus as verifying expansion results and invariants via mocks; avoid introducing new recurrence libs

16. Adaptation Outcome Summary

- Reuse: High; minimal new utilities required
- Changes: Introduce runners, deterministic time helpers, and recurrence test coverage
- Artifact Structure: Designated folders adopted; existing datetime assets mirrored via runner

17. Re-run Under Matrix and Next Steps

- After scripts are implemented, run full matrix across all listed timezones for:
  - Existing category tests
  - New recurrence tests
- Publish artifacts and update [integration_test_overview.md](../../tests/integration/integration_test_overview.md) including the Recurring Event Processing table

18. Appendices

- Environment capture fields:
  - nodeVersion, icuVersion, intlTimeZoneCount, defaultIntlTimeZone, os
- Naming convention example:
  - date_time_dst_spring_forward_results_20250907T120000Z.json
