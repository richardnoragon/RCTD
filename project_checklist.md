This should bypass the error about missing icon files and allow the application
to compile
and run.

For a production build, you would want to add proper icon files to the icons directory, but for development purposes, this empty array should work fine. If you need the icons later, you can use tools like Tauri's icon generator or create them manually.

Note that in a complete setup, you would normally have the following icon files:

icons/32x32.png (small icon for Windows)
icons/128x128.png (standard size icon)
icons/128x128@2x.png (high-resolution icon)
icons/icon.icns (macOS icon)
icons/icon.ico (Windows icon)
Let me know if you encounter any other issues while running the application!
